* gpg
** symetric encryption
*** encryption of a file
if you have a file: secret.txt
to encrypt it:
=gpg -c --no-symkey-cache --cipher-algo AES256 secret.txt=
it will alsk you to enter a passphrase
- -c is for symetric key encryption
- --no-symkey-cache to not register the passphrase on the machine where
  the file is encrypted
- --cipher-algo AES256 to specify the encryption algo, which is more
  secure than the default

*** directory
if it's a directory, archive it first:
=tar -cf pepes.tar.gz rare_pepes/=
then encrypt it like a file
*** decryption
to decrypt it: 
=gpg secret.txt.gpg=
*** integrity
you can use sha256 (?) to check for integrity of your file, if you
make a sha256 of your file before sending it to a cloud or whatever,
and then checking the sha of the downloaded file and the sha you
created before sending.
