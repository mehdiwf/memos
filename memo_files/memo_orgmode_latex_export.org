#+begin_comment
Common options can be called easily with =C-c C-e #=
#+end_comment

#+begin_comment
if you want to see images inline by default
#+end_comment
#+startup: inlineimages

#+begin_comment
this allows me to place the toc where I want, with
#+TOC: headlines 2
at the place I want
#+end_comment
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

#+begin_comment
see 
https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-Settings.html
to know what options you have
for instance you could do:
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil date:nil 
#+end_comment

* Basic stuff
** Writing stuff
So this is my first emacs/latex export... nice![fn:1:Oh it can also do footnotes!]
And if I return.[fn:2:With the RET key...]
It stays in the same sentence.[fn:3:Useful for structuring your text!]
As latex does.

But if I return two times, it interprets this as a new paragraph... as latex does.

#+begin_comment
These comments will not be exported!
You can do footnotes sort automatic and inline by default in your init.el like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  (setq org-footnote-auto-adjust t)
  (setq org-footnote-define-inline t)
#+end_src

also the key binding for footnotes in org is =C-C C-x f= 
#+end_comment

You can also put things like *that* or like _that_ or like /that/... or
even like +that+!

\newpage

You can also put a new page!

----------
and vertical lines... for more info, check org manual!
** an overview of options
You can also put options at the start of your document (or anywhere
actually?) to change things in the export:

#+begin_example
for class and options:
#+latex_class: article
#+latex_class_options:

enable table of contents:
#+options: toc:t 
disable table of contents:
#+options: toc:nil
#+end_example
You can see *all* the options you can set in [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-Settings.html#Export-Settings][Org mode manual export settings]].
* Pdf opening
Editing your pdf and viewing the result in emacs is even more
pleasant, you can open you pdfs in emacs, even after an export by
using:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(use-package org-pdftools
  :hook (org-mode . org-pdftools-setup-link))

(add-to-list 'org-file-apps 
             '("\\.pdf\\'" . (lambda (file link)
                                     (org-pdftools-open link))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ((\.pdf\' lambda (file link) (org-pdftools-open link)) (auto-mode . emacs) (directory . emacs) (\.mm\' . default) (\.x?html?\' . default) (\.pdf\' . default))

in your init file

and yeah, you can put source code in your pdf. This code can be
highlighted with minted for instance, but I don't know how :). You can
also ask org to show the results on the pdf too! By putting\\
=:results output :exports result= \\
after your\\
=#+begin_src python=\\
in orgmode
------------
:todo:
#+begin_src python :results output :exports result
def f(a, b, c):
    d = a+b+c
    return d
print( f(1,2,5) )

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 8

And here is the result!

------------

* Tables
** basic tables
you can also have tables

#+name: cool table
#+label: coot_table
| a | b |    c |
| 1 | 3 |    4 |
| 3 | 2 | 1.32 |

** importing csv tables
There is a way to import csv file as table in org mode!
Like this, you just need to execute all code blocks

(C-c C-v C-b org-babel-execute-buffer)

To update all the tables!! You can even have a bash code block that
copies the tables in their origin directory to the .org directory like
so:

#+begin_src bash
cp sourcefile outputfile
#+end_src

(look at [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-python.html][this tutorial]] to understand everything done here)

#+name: panda2org
#+begin_src python :var df="df" :exports none
  return f"return tabulate({df}, headers={df}.columns, tablefmt='orgtbl')"
#+end_src

#+header: :prologue from tabulate import tabulate
#+header: :noweb strip-export
#+begin_src python :results value raw :exports results
  import pandas as pd
  filename = "/home/mehdi/dossiers/ilm/mesures_brevet_condense/rapport/atelier/archive/metals_csv_young.csv"
  df = pd.read_csv(filename, index_col=0)

  <<panda2org("df")>>
#+end_src

* Managing references
** Installation
You can install [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] which provides great... ref tools!

Personnally, I had this error when trying to use some functions:
=Symbol’s function definition is void: org-ref-possible-bibfiles= But
with the config snippet below, and after deleting and re-installing
org-ref manually (via M-x list-packages) it works well!

Put this in your init file, replacing your default reference
keybindings by your preference: (you will need the [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general]] package to
create my bindings)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(use-package org-ref
  :after org-mode)

(setq reftex-default-bibliography '("~/Documents/srx/bibliographie/references.bib"))

;; see org-ref for use of these variables
(setq org-ref-bibliography-notes "~/Documents/srx/bibliographie/notes.org"
      org-ref-default-bibliography '("~/Documents/srx/bibliographie/references.bib")
      org-ref-pdf-directory "~/Documents/srx/bibliographie/bibtex-pdfs/")

;; helps org export to latex to handle well bibliography
(setq org-latex-pdf-process
      '("pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
	"bibtex %b"
	"pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
	"pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))

(require 'org-ref)
(general-define-key  
  "C-c ("  'org-ref-helm-insert-ref-link
  "C-c ["  'org-ref-helm-insert-cite-link)

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** Tools unlocked!
*** Linking your bibfile
This tools allows you to link a bibliography file to your org-document
and pick references from it. For that, create a file called
bibfile.bib in the same directory as your org file (you can replace
bibfile.bib by bibdir/bibfile.bib if your bibfile is in bibdir)

And connect your bibfile with:
#+begin_example
bibliography:bibfile.bib 
#+end_example

at the end of your file

And then you can open it as an org link and modifiy the content of
your bibfile with some really handy functions!

*** Adding bibtex entry
In [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t925KRBbFc][this video]] created by org-ref creator, you can see in 00:45 that he
can get the bib entry just by dragging pdf in your bibfile. But I
prefer to use these functions that I call with =M-x=:

- =doi-add-bibtex-entry=
- =crossref-add-bibtex-entry=

=doi-add-bibtex-entry= can get a bibtex entry if you feed it the DOI,
and =crossref-add-bibtex-entry= tries to find the entry if you feed it a
reference (commonly seen in bibliography) like:

/M. Schlichenmaier, An elementary proof of the vanishing of the/
/secondcohomology of the witt and virasoro algebra with values in the
adjointmodule,Forum Mathematicum26(2011)/

If it finds more than one candidate, you will have to choose the one
that fits. *AND* I think it will try to download the file if possible,
so be careful that it doesn't fill your bibtex-pdf/ directory for no reasons.

*** Citing a paper in your bibfile

You can cite a paper that is in your bibfile by pressing =C-c [= (or
=org-ref-helm-insert-ref-link=) and then typing a pattern that is on the
name of the paper or the name of an anthor, and it will find the thing
that fits best (you can also use =C-n= and =C-p=).
cite:silveira09_low_dimen_model_stick_slip

This citation is generated by this snippet:
#+begin_example
cite:silveira09_low_dimen_model_stick_slip
#+end_example

You can also cite more than one by marking them with =C-SPC= and then
press =RET=. cite:soize08_robus_updat_uncer_comput_model,bera2021quantum

Or alternate cites
like citenum:soize08_robus_updat_uncer_comput_model 
(actually it doesn't work, I don't know why.)

\newpage

* Latex embedded
let's say that we wanna write an equation. Well, we use a latex export
code block =C-c C-, l=:

#+begin_example
#+begin_export latex

\begin{equation} \label{integral}
\int_{a}^{b}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}f_n(t)dt 
\end{equation}

#+end_export
#+end_example

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation} \label{integral}
\int_{a}^{b}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}f_n(t)dt 
\end{equation}
#+end_export

to refer to this equation, you can use =C-(= or
=org-ref-helm-insert-ref-link:= please see equation ref:integral

citation created by:
#+begin_example
ref:integral 
#+end_example

or rather equation eqref:integral

citation created by:
#+begin_example
eqref:integral 
#+end_example

the bindings I have, which are =C-c (= and =C-c [= are my preferences, but
you can modify them in the config easily if you look at them on the
snippet I gave earlier for installation.

You can also refer to things called in org:

label:table
#+attr_export: :placement [H]
#+caption: a tinyyy table
| a | b |
| 1 | 2 |

look at the table ref:table

\newpage

#+begin_src python :exports none :results silent
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, np.pi)
y = np.sinh(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sinh(x)')
plt.savefig('sinh.png')
#+end_src

#+attr_latex: :placement [H] :scale 0.3
#+caption: plotting is a sinh. label:fig-sinh
[[./sinh.png]]

The results are in Figure ref:fig-sinh.\\
The caption and label is set just before the link of the image in org
mode by:
#+begin_example
#+caption: plotting is a sinh. label:fig-sinh
#+end_example
and you can put labels and caption before anything you want!
|---+---|
| A | B |
|---+---|
| 1 | 2 |

(the org-mode way of citing things is to put =#+label: thing= ) (but I
didn't test it, as org ref helps a lot finding your labels)

The only thing that I don't know how to do it is to have a keybinding
to refresh visualisation when using insert ref/citation (I had to
revert buffer to have the new things), and how to insert a label (but
typing label: isn't that hard so...)

* Problem?
We may have a problem on numbering refs ... see the table? Maybe it's
because I used multiple labelling methods?

\vspace{2cm}

You can write (org-ref way)
#+begin_example
label:test
#+end_example

or in a latex block (latex way)

#+begin_example
#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:labeldeouf}
  a + b = yay
\end{equation}
#+end_export 
#+end_example

or even (I think): (org-mode way)
#+begin_example
#+name: coolname
#+end_example
